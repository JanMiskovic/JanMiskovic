# Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹(\*^â–½^\*)
My name is JÃ¡n and I'm a 23 year old developer from Slovakia.\
I've earned my bachelor's degree at Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, Slovakia, 2022,\
and I'm currently working as a full-stack developer at [**MICROCOMP**](https://www.microcomp.sk/).

I started freelancing as a web developer in 2020 and my interest in the field has grown more and more over time as I learned new technologies. Initially I started with WordPress, making custom sites through an editor called Elementor. I've been playing around with CSS and JS in my own projects in the meantime, and in 2022 I felt like I knew enough to jump into React, which I've been loving since.

At work, I'm mainly coding in `C#` and `ASP.NET`.

My primary stack (for personal projects) currently consists of `Next.js`, `Tailwind CSS`\
and `Framer Motion`, inspired mostly by [Sam Selikoff](https://www.youtube.com/c/SamSelikoff) and [Theo Browne](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheoBrowne1017).
