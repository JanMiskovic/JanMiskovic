# Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹(\*^â–½^\*)
My name is JÃ¡n and I'm a 22 year old Applied Informatics student from Slovakia.\
I've studied at Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, Slovakia for 3 years,\
and I'm currently freelancing / looking to get hired full time.

I started freelancing as a web developer in 2020 and my interest in this field has grown more and more over time as I learned new technologies. Initially I started with WordPress, creating pages through a drag&drop editor called Elementor. I've been playing around a lot with CSS and JS in my own projects in the meantime, and in 2022 I felt like I knew enough to jump into React, which I've been loving since.

Currently my stack consists of `Next.js`, `Tailwind CSS` and `Framer Motion`,\
mostly inspired by great devs like [Sam Selikoff](https://www.youtube.com/c/SamSelikoff) and [Theo Browne](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheoBrowne1017).
